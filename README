This update consists of the following items:

1. some supplementary files: 
    - county_layout_2015.txt, which 
      explains the variables in the 
      original tables and explains 
      the noise that was added to 
      some of them, to protect 
      sensitive business information. 
    - naics_broad, which associates 
      NAICS codes to industries, 
      broadly defined. (E.g., 
      "Forestry, Hunting, and 
      Fishing" rather than "Deep Sea 
      Angling.)
    - georef12, which associates 
      geographical codes with county 
      names

2. create_tables - an R script which 
   imports, cleans, and creates 
   dataframes from the csv files 
   described above.

3. bp_plotter - an R script which 
   creates some visualizations from 
   the dataframes described above. 

4. visualizations - a folder 
   containing 3 subfolders, each of 
   which contains some visualizations 
   of changes in a given measure of 
   business health (number of 
   employees, number of 
   establishments, and annual 
   payroll) in each of the 5 largest 
   metropolitan areas of New York   
   State, faceted by industry.


PLEASE NOTE: 

   1. I have not attached the tables 
   containing the data that I analyzed, 
   because they are too large. But these
   tables can be found at 
   https://www.census.gov/programs-
   surveys/cbp/data/datasets.html.
   
   2. To make the scope of the project 
   manageable in this early stage, I 
   have limited my focus to the years 
   2012-2016 (inclusive) and to the 
   5 largest metropolitan areas of 
   New York State. In later 
   iterations, I will consider a wider
   range of geographical areas and 
   years.
